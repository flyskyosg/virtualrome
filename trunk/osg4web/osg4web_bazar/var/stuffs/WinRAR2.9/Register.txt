 |                            YOU REGISTER RAR                            |
 +------------------------------------------------------------------------+

   1. Because, as a registered user, you:

   1) Encourage the author to further develop and improve RAR,
      making possible new RAR releases;

   2) May use RAR in commercial and other environments;

   3) Gain access to the Authenticity Verification and other advanced 
      features;

   4) Access support and assistance, via E-mail and RAR Support
      Sites, worldwide;

   5) Gain the right to use ALL future RAR releases, on the same OS
      platform, in the registered mode. When a major version number
      is changed, it may be deemed necessary, due to the activities
      of hackers, to change the registration method. If this happens,
      an upgrade diskette will be available from your local registration
      site for a small charge to cover postage and handling.

 +------------------------------------------------------------------------+

   Upon receipt of your registration fee with the completed registration
   form you will receive a registration key file which will correspond to
   the registration string given in the registration form.
 
   Upon receipt of your registration key file you should copy it to the
   WinRAR folder. If the key is archived, in a .RAR file, please extract
   the key from the archive in order to register your copy of WinRAR.
 
   It is possible, depending upon the facilities available at your local
   registration site, to have the key delivered to you by e-mail or by
   your local postal service on diskette.
